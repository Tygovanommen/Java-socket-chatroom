# Java socket chatroom
A desktop socket chat application

**[Server](/server)** and **[User](/user)** layer are separate applications. The Server layer only sets up the connection to the socket port and the Users layer connects to this created socket server.

## How to use

Change the **port** and **host** property to desired value in [server.properties](/server.properties) and [user.properties](/user.properties)

``` Java
port = 5000
host = localhost
```

1. Execute Server layer, either on local PC or on a server. Make sure the layer is active throughout the chatting process.
2. Start the User layer on one or more environments.
3. Start chatting in the User layer application!
