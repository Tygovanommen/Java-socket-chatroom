## How to use

Change the **port** and **host** property to desired value in [server.properties](/server.properties) and [user.properties](/user.properties)

``` 
port = 5000
host = localhost
```

Before you open the client executable, make sure the Server layer is up and running. This can be either on a local PC or on a server.
